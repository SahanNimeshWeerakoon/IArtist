      <li>Option 1: "npm start" every time saving. </li>
      <li>Option 2: If you have nodemon installed, you can use "npm run server". By this way, you don't need to "npm start" every time there's a changes. If not having nodemon yet, "npm install -g nodemon" for globally installed in your machine.</li>
